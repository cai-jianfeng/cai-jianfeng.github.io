<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">This paper proposes the Flowmind2digital method and hdFlowmind dataset to address the convertion of hand-drawn flowchart/mindmap. 
Flowmind2digital is an comprehensive recognition and conversion method for flowminds, utilizing a neural network architecture and keypoint detection technology to enhance overall recognition accuracy. 
Our hdFlowmind dataset consists of 1,776 hand-drawn and manually annotated flowminds, covering 22 scenarios and surpassing existing datasets in size. 
Our experiments showcase the effectiveness of our method, with an accuracy rate of 87.3% on the hdFlowmind dataset, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art work by 11.9%. 
Additionally, our dataset demonstrates effectiveness, with a 2.9% increase in accuracy after pre-training and fine-tuning on Handwritten-diagram-dataset. 
We also highlight the importance of simple graphics for sketch recognition, which can improve accuracy by 9.3%. </p>
